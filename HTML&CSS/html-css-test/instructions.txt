In this directory, please implement a website similar to the one shown in "./design.png".

GUIDELINES

 1. Keep styles in "./styles.css".
 2. The font-family is "Helvetica".
 3. All links should point to "http://www.google.com".
 4. The four links in the navigation have their color set to "aqua". On hover, their color should be set to "#fff".
 5. The two links in the footer should have an underline. They should have no hover state.
 6. The logo is included in this directory as "./logo.png".
 7. The image is included in this directory as "./hands.jpg".
 8. Do not worry about exact spacing, sizing, etc., just implement something close to the design. For reference, the header is 1000px wide, including padding.
 9. The three columns take up 1/3 of their space, including padding. Make sure the columns are balanced, i.e., all columns will be as tall as the tallest column.
10. Do your best to write SEO-friendly HTML, with a legible stylesheet.
11. Make sure your code works on a recent version of Chrome.
12. When you are finished, zip the directory and rename it `html-css-test-${firstName}-${lastName}.zip`.
